# KAGGLE
## This Repository will be used to monitor my progress 
## on the courses available on Kaggle.

#### It contains both the lesson notes and exercises taken for each lesson.

##          ORGANISATION.
### 1. The first folder in the directory represents the name of the course, e.g :PYTHON
### 2. Folders inside the subsequent directory would represent each class on the course. call it "Class Directory"
### 3. Each "Class Directory" contains the notes on the class and the exercise for that class.

PS. "emptyfile.txt" files found in each "Class Directory" was used to open a folder as github doesn't allow you to open an empty folder before uploading your files. :smile:
