But in fact, it takes a very hands-off approach. When you define a new type, you can choose how addition works for it, or what it means for an object of that type to be equal to something else.\n\nThe designers of lists decided that adding them to numbers wasn't allowed. The designers of `numpy` arrays went a different way (adding the number to each element of the array).\n\nHere are a few more examples of how `numpy` arrays interact unexpectedly with Python operators (or at least differently from lists)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# At which indices are the dice less than or equal to 3?\nrolls <= 3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"xlist = [[1,2,3],[2,4,6],]\n# Create a 2-dimensional array\nx = numpy.asarray(xlist)\nprint(\"xlist = {}\\nx =\\n{}\".format(xlist, x))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get the last element of the second row of our numpy array\nx[1,-1]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"tags":["raises-exception"],"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get the last element of the second sublist of our nested list?\nxlist[1,-1]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"numpy's `ndarray` type is specialized for working with multi-dimensional data, so it defines its own logic for indexing, allowing us to index by a tuple to specify the index at each dimension.\n\n### When does 1 + 1 not equal 2?\n\nThings can get weirder than this.

The example above features something like **5** different overloaded operators. What's each of those operations doing? It can help to know the answer when things start going wrong."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Curious how it all works?\n\nHave you ever called `help()` or `dir()` on an object and wondered what the heck all those names with the double-underscores were?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(dir(list))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This turns out to be directly related to operator overloading.\n\nWhen Python programmers want to define how operators behave on their types, they do so by implementing methods with special names beginning and ending with 2 underscores such as `__lt__`, `__setattr__`, or `__contains__`. Generally, names that follow this double-underscore format have a special meaning to Python.\n\nSo, for example, the expression `x in [1, 2, 3]` is actually calling the list method `__contains__` behind-the-scenes. It's equivalent to (the much uglier) `[1, 2, 3].__contains__(x)`. \n\nIf you're curious to learn more, you can check out [Python's official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names), which describes many, many more of these special \"underscores\" methods.\n\nWe won't be defining our own types in these lessons (if only there was time!), but I hope you'll get to experience the joys of defining your own wonderful, weird types later down the road."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Your turn!\n\nHead over to **[the final coding exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/1275190)** for one more round of coding questions involving imports, working with unfamiliar objects, and, of course, more gambling."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
